<p>This is a great plan! Here are some steps you can follow to start your journey in learning .NET and building web apps with ASP.NET Core:</p>
<p><strong>1. Install Visual Studio:</strong></p>
<p>Visual Studio is an integrated development  environment (IDE) used for .NET development. You can download the latest version of Visual Studio from the official Microsoft website.</p>
<p><strong>2. Learn C#:</strong></p>
<p>C# is a programming language used for .NET development.</p>
<p>There are plenty of free resources available online to learn C# programming language. Here are a few resources to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/"><strong>Microsoft C# Documentation:</strong></a> Microsoft&rsquo;s official documentation is an excellent resource for learning C# programming language. It&rsquo;s free, and it covers everything from basic syntax to advanced topics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/c-sharp"><strong>Codecademy:</strong></a> Codecademy offers a free interactive course on C# programming language. The course is divided into sections and includes exercises to help you practice what you learn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php"><strong>W3Schools:</strong></a> W3Schools provides a free online tutorial on C# programming language. It covers basic syntax, data types, arrays, loops, and more.</p>
