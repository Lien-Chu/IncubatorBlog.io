      <description>What are the Admin and User roles in ASP.NET used for? The Admin and User roles are used to control access to different areas of a web application based on the user&amp;rsquo;s role.
The Admin role typically has access to all areas of the application, including sensitive administrative functions such as user management, system settings, and other restricted areas.
The User role, on the other hand, typically has limited access to the application and can only perform certain actions or access certain areas of the application.</description>
